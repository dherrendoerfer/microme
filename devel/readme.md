#### Notes:

* You also need the uVGA library fork installed from my github.
* You also need the Teensy-ReSID library installed from Frank B.
* The contents of ./Library need to go into your Arduino library folder.
* Each folder contains the sketch projects for the respective controller on the microME board.

Currently I am using a Teensy3.5 as the main controller, a Teensy3.2 as the Co-Processor, and an Arduino Nano for the IO.

This is ALPHA code !!
